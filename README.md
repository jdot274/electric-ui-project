# Electric UI Installation and Setup Complete

I've successfully installed Electric UI and set up a new project:

1. **Installed Electric UI's `arc` tool** using the installer script
2. **Created a new Electric UI project** named "My Electric UI Project"
3. **Set up the project dependencies** including Electron and VSCode SDKs
4. **Started the application** using `arc start`
5. **Created documentation** in `electric-ui-installation.md` that details the installation process and project structure

## Project Overview

The created project is an Electron-based application designed to interface with microcontrollers. It includes:

- A React/TypeScript UI with components for device connection and control
- Serial communication capabilities for talking to hardware
- An example LED control interface with visualization and slider controls
- Custom codecs for encoding/decoding messages between the UI and hardware

## Next Steps

To continue developing with Electric UI:

1. **Connect a microcontroller** - The application is ready to connect to a compatible device
2. **Customize the UI** - Modify the components in `src/application/` to suit your needs
3. **Add new message types** - Extend the typedState.ts and create new codecs as needed
4. **Build and deploy** - Use `arc build` when ready to create a distributable application

The application is currently running in development mode. You can access it through the Electron window that opened when you ran `arc start`.
