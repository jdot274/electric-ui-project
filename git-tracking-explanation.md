# Git Tracking Explanation

## Current Repository Status

1. **What IS Being Tracked** (47 files):
   - Only the files in `electric-ui-backup-march-1-2025/`
   - Source code, configuration files, and small assets
   - Successfully pushed to GitHub in the `github-backup-march-1-2025` branch

2. **What is NOT Being Tracked** (but causing warnings):
   - All the untracked files in your working directory (20,000+ files)
   - Large binaries, node_modules, and temporary files
   - These files are not in your Git repository, but are sitting in your working directory

## Understanding Git Warnings

The warning message "too many active changes" means:
- Git sees many files in your working directory that are not tracked
- This can slow down Git operations but doesn't affect what's actually committed
- These untracked files are NOT part of your repository and won't be pushed to GitHub

## Actions You Can Take

If you want to eliminate the Git warnings:
1. Use `.gitignore` to silence warnings about specific directories
2. Work in a clean directory with fewer untracked files
3. Use `git clean -fd` to remove untracked files (use with caution)

## Conclusion

Our backup strategy is working correctly - we're only tracking 47 essential files in the backup branch, not 20,000+ files. The warning is about your local working directory, not about files being tracked in the repository.
