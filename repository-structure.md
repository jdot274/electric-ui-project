# Repository Structure and Organization

## Current Status

The Git repository has been successfully restructured with:

1. **Main Project Branch**: `main-project`
   - Contains the actual Electric UI project source code
   - Excludes node_modules, build artifacts, and other large files
   - Properly configured with .gitignore

2. **Backup Branch**: `github-backup-march-1-2025`
   - Contains a clean copy of the March 1, 2025 backup
   - Organized in a dedicated directory structure
   - Documentation included

## GitHub Access

Both branches are now available on GitHub:
- Main project: https://github.com/jdot274/electric-ui-project/tree/main-project
- Backup: https://github.com/jdot274/electric-ui-project/tree/github-backup-march-1-2025

## Local Files Organization

1. **Tracked Files**:
   - Essential Electric UI project files (source code, configuration, documentation)
   - .gitignore file to prevent tracking unnecessary files

2. **Untracked Files** (excluded by .gitignore):
   - node_modules and build directories
   - Large binary files
   - Temporary and backup files
   - Other project directories (neo4j, component-sandbox, etc.)

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Clean Repository Structure**:
   - Removed nested Git repositories (.git directory inside electric-ui-project)
   - Properly organized files in logical structure

2. **Efficient Storage**:
   - Excluded large binaries and dependencies from Git
   - Local backup preserved as compressed archive

3. **Proper Documentation**:
   - Created documentation files explaining the backup and repository structure
   - Added comments and clear commit messages

## Next Steps

1. If desired, the main-project branch can be merged to master/main
2. Continue development on the main-project branch
3. Clean up any temporary files as needed
